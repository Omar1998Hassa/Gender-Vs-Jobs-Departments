# Gender Preferences in Jobs/Departments Analysis

This code aims to investigate whether there are discernible differences in job and department preferences between men and women using the Glassdoor Gender Pay dataset. The analysis begins with a chi-square test to assess the overall significance of gender-based preferences. Subsequently, a more granular examination is conducted to identify specific jobs and departments that may exhibit gender-specific preferences.
